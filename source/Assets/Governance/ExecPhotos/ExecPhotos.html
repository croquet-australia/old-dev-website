            <p align="left">Neil is a member of Brighton club in South Australia.<br />
              He commenced playing croquet at South Terrace club in late 1990's and  filled the roles of Secretary and President.   Whilst at South Terrace he took on the task of organising inter-club  Golf Croquet competitions in South Australia and chaired the initial Golf  Croquet committee for SACA.    With  changes in residences Neil moved to Holdfast Bay club and later to  Brighton.   <br />
              Neil captained SA's initial interstate Golf croquet team which competed  in Newcastle.<br />
              Neil has held the position of President of SACA for the past two years  a position that he is relinquishing to take up the VP role on ACA. He has  concentrated on golf croquet in the past few years but has decided to try his  hand at Association Croquet again this year. Neil chairs (jointly with Max  Murray) the Organising Committee for the 2012 World's Event in Adelaide.<br />
              Neil's main interest outside croquet (is there anything outside  croquet??) is travel and he and wife Heather travel as frequently as possible.</p>

              (Treasurer)</h2>
            <p align="left">Jim started in croquet in 2005, when he was a foundation member of the Sarsfield Croquet Club, elected as the inaugural Secretary and Public Officer and appointed as the club’s delegate to the Gippsland Croquet Association, positions he retains today.  He accredited as a Golf Croquet referee the following year and has since officiated at club, regional, state, national and international events.  He has a deep interest in GC Rules and contributes articles on the rules to magazines and newsletters. Jim was elected Secretary of Croquet Victoria in June 2010 and re-elected in June 2012 for another two year term.  He commenced to understudy the ACA Treasurer in 2009, was appointed as ACA Assistant Treasurer in 2010 when that position was established and retained the position, with a short hiatus, until elected Honorary Treasurer in March 2013. In his community Jim is Secretary/Treasurer of both the Bairnsdale Junior Cricket Association and of the local Sarsfield Recreation Reserve Committee of Management. Jim &amp; his wife, Sandy, live on a five acre block in rural Sarsfield, near Bairnsdale Vic,  which is in a mobile phone black hole (and a digital TV grey hole); their two sons and three grandchildren live in Tasmania.   When not administering, refereeing or playing croquet, he is busy looking after his orchard and vegetable garden on the block he and Sandy share with two Boxer pups, an Angora goat and chickens. </p>
