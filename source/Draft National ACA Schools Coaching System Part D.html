      <h3><strong>MATERIAL,  MARKETING MARKETING MATERIAL</strong></h3>
      <h5><strong>ATTEMPTS AT MARKETING  STRATEGY:</strong></h5>
     <h3><strong>SAMPLE LEAFLET FOR  SCHOOLS : </strong></h3>
      <p>Malletsports  is the Only Sport with the Two Ball Shot.  </p>
      <p><img src="Assets/Kids2/Images/PartD_clip_image002.gif" alt="" width="481" height="291" /></p>
      <p>Speculate  : It stretches the brain, and may contribute to the laying down of beneficial  neural pathways.  It is a shot that may  help co-ordination of both brain hemispheres and eventually increase creative  powers and problem solving.</p>
      <p>Why  not explore this with your students ?</p>
      <p>It  may answer lots of your VELS (Victorian Essential Learning Standards) needs in  all three strands, Physical and Personal and Social Learning, Discipline Based  Learning and Interdisciplinary Learning.</p>
      <p>We  believe that happiness will increase achievement.</p>
      <p>Malletsports  is a great adjunct to other sports. Malletsports can bring to consciousness the  tactics and strategies of grab and stash games like Football, Netball. It can  impart team and pathway thinking. It can be co-operative, gradually introducing  competitiveness and only then encouraging aggressiveness.</p>
      <p>There  is a pathway of variants from self-development and discovery to games as  competitive and aggressive as Football.</p>
      <p>We  have great games, and want to form great partnerships with Schools and also  train up School Teachers and Coaches to be able to impart the benefits of  Malletsports right through to VET programs.</p>
      <p>Currently,  Victoria has several school aged players playing in the top international  events.</p>
      <p>With  good coaching from early years, these skills and brain stretching can belong to  your students too.</p>
      <p>We  have worked to make our Schools Programs contain the elements of Learning that  match current educational thinking. Experiential, Fun Skills Acquisition  leading to Problem Based Discovery Learning, with the possibility for  Reflection, with Team based and Individual Co-operations and Competition, in a  Whole of Life learning setting.</p>
      <p>Let  us help you to introduce Malletsports to your School.</p>

      <h3><strong>SAMPLE PAPER FOR SPORTS  TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS COACHES :</strong><br />
        <strong>MALLETSPORTS AS AN  ADJUNCT TO OTHER SPORTS :</strong></h3>
      <p>Malletsports  is a complex series of skills, strategies and human elements.<br />
      Because  of its richness, depth and variety, it has benefits for many othersports.</p>
      <p><img src="Assets/Kids2/Images/PartD_clip_image004.gif" alt="" width="551" height="403" /></p>
      <p>The  basis of this is that it is many other sports In Slow Motion and On the  Perceivable Surface.  We bring the  components to the surface.</p>
      <p>This  goes from its benefits in learning to aim, useful in target sports, to the  benefits it can bring to players of Football.</p>
      <p>In  the skill of aiming, for instance, we break down every constituent part of the  process of aiming, and do that deliberatively, and as consciously as we  can.  By this segmentation, the skill can  soon become intuitive.</p>
      <p>For  sports like Football, several of our diverse sports can each assist the player  to bring to the conscious surface what it really going on.  Because this is done in Slow Motion, the  player can really think about the best strategy.<br />
        We  find Football Coaches actively seek out malletsports for this purpose.<br />
        I&rsquo;ll  go into some depth :  to show two aspects  of Football that we can be useful with.</p>
      <p>Both  Croquet and Football share the same goal : to get a ball, get it to a &lsquo;nest&rsquo;  and stash it.  Both are also Invasion  games.  There are many such grab and  stash sports, such as basketball, netball etc.</p>
      <p>This  involves two things : one, getting the ball also means excluding the opponent  from possession, and also, solving the puzzle of finding the pathway to the  nest, goalposts or hoop.  The exclusion  part of the game of football is somewhat hidden in the speed and energy. In  Malletsports we are able to deal with these issues with clarity.</p>
      <p>In  one game we have, golf croquet, the exclusion is done very carefully and with  great thought.  It may or may not  work.  This emulates the aggression and  competition of football.  The actual  strategies are nearly visible.</p>
      <p>In  another game we have, real thought is given to How to get the ball to the Hoop.  In football, for instance, once the player has the ball, we are able to  separate and bring to the surface in an observable slow motion, the usual high  speed thoughts of how to get to the goal. </p>
      <p>The  opposition are about to make a Goal !   Oh, no, what can our team do ?<br />
        The  player kicks, but young Joe has intercepted and taken a mark.<br />
        But  our goalposts now seem a long way off.   Joe wonders &lsquo;How can I get the ball to our end ?&rsquo;<br />
        Hey,  Joe, over here, calls team mate Tom<br />
        Lew  calls : Joe, over here, mate and Frank, Here, no here.<br />
        Joe  has to see beyond the obvious : well who will Tom pass it too ?<br />
        How  will Joe get an overview of all this and make the right decision ?<br />
        Get  Joe playing Puzzle Croquet, and give him some extra skills.</p>
      <p>We  gradually progress players from Learning competence and feeling good with being  able to do something, to co-operative games, through to competitive puzzle based  games, and to more competitive and aggressive games.</p>
      <p>Let  Malletsports be an adjunct to your Sport.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><strong>SAMPLE AD FOR A COACH</strong> Done as an Ad for Brunswick :</h3>
