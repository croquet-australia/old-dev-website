	  <h3>This is an easy way to introduce Golf Croquet. It should simplify the game and make it fun
	    for beginners.
</h3>
	  <div class="dmxAccordion" id="dmxAccordion1">
	    <h3> <a href="#dmxAccordion1-1"><strong>Lesson One</strong></a></h3>
        <div id="dmxAccordion1-1">
          <ul>
            <li>Introduce the beginner to club members and show them around the
              club house.</li>
            <li>Talk about personal safety (the hazards involved in the game) i.e.
              walking backwards without looking, beware of hoops and balls, wear a sun
              hat, sun screen and drink plenty of fluids.</li>
            <li>Tell them a little about the history of the game and why you enjoy
              playing the game.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The Mallet</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Show the beginner the mallet and explain the face, the "sweet spot"
              and how it is weighted. </li>
            <li>Measure the player for a mallet.</li>
            <li>A mallet length that is suitable should come just past wrist height
              when standing to attention. he
              grip should be comfortable. he<br>
              shape of the mallet head makes no difference to the way a ball is hit.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The Grip</strong></p>
          <o:p></o:p>
          <ul>
            <li>Get the new player to grip the very top of the mallet handle with
              their &quot;dominant hand&quot; as if choking it. </li>
            <li>With the other hand make a gun. Point the index finger down to the mallet head, then slide the hand up to meet the other hand at the top of the mallet. This forms the Standard Grip&nbsp;(if the beginner starts to get sore wrists I then show other
              grips).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The Feet</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Turn the mallet head sideways in front of the player's feet. Get the player to point their toes to each end of the mallet head and keep their feet parallel. This is the distance the feet need to be apart, it is about shoulder width.</li>
            <li>Turn the mallet head the right way and place it about one inch (1&quot;) in front of their feet. This is the hitting position.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The Swing</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Practice the swing (without a ball).</li>
            <li>Ask the player to notice how the weight in the mallet head works like a pendulum. Try to keep it simple.</li>
            <p> <strong>Hitting a ball</strong></p>
            <li>Set a ball in front of the player and ask them to &quot;stalk&quot; the ball, settle the stance, keep their head down, swing through and hit the ball. Give the beginner lots of practice at hitting the ball. Keep reminding them to &quot;stalk&quot; the ball, settle the stance and keep looking at the ball as they hit. </li>
            <li>Also explain that when drawing a straight line three points are needed, the same applies when hitting a ball straight. The points to use are; the centre of your body, the centre of the ball and the point where you want the ball to go.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Running a Hoop</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Once the beginner achieves consistency in hitting the ball, introduce them to hoop running. </li>
            <li>Explain that the principles of hitting in a straight line are the same and now the aiming point will be the centre of the hoop. I often put a marker in the ground at the centre of the hoop to give the player a point to aim at.</li>
            <li>Let the player practice until they gain confidence. Always remind them to stalk the &quot;line&quot;.</li>
            <li> If the player is still having problems, stand in front of them and look at their swing through the hoop and check their feet:
              <ul>
                <li>Are their feet parallel?</li>
                <li>Are they swinging on line?</li>
                <li>Are they moving the head of the mallet in a straight line after their stance is set?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Get the player to let go of the mallet before they hit the ball, then tell them to come around to front and check the line they are taking, looking through the hoop. This often helps.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Hitting Another Ball </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li> Now place a second ball no more than a foot away. Get the player to walk the line, (The centre of their body, the centre of the striker's ball and the centre of the ball they want to hit).</li>
            <li> The emphasis now is &quot;hit the ball - don't just tap it.&quot; This will encourage the player to clear a ball when playing. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>A Game </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Explain the order of the first six hoops, the starting corner, the partner balls and the order in which the balls are played in relation to the colours on the peg. (I have a broom handle marked with the second colours that I place beside the court if we are to use second colours). Once these details have been explained, the beginner is ready to play a basic game of Golf Croquet with the knowledge they have gained so far.</li>
            <li>Place a peg in front of the first hoop in the ideal position to run the hoop. This gives the player an aiming point from the starting corner.</li>
            <li>When the player is at hoop one, explain how to tell whether a ball has run the hoop or not. Explain the &quot;playing&quot; and &quot;non-playing&quot; side of the hoop.</li>
            <li>If a ball leaves the court, explain how it is placed on the sideline.</li>
            <li>The half way line can also be explained during the game. </li>
            <li>Let the beginners have fun and enjoy a game without too many rules while still running hoops and hitting opponent's balls away. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Hopefully the beginner will come back for lesson 2. </strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <h3> <a href="#dmxAccordion1-2"><strong>Lesson Two</strong></a></h3>
        <div id="dmxAccordion1-2">
          <p>Revise all that was taught in lesson one. The stance, swing, head down, the line of hit. Give the beginner time to practice. </p>
          <p><strong>Trick Shots</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>This is the time to introduce the stop-shot and demonstrate a jump shot. (These are shots that impress beginners).</li>
            <li></li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stop Shot</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Move their feet back</li>
                <li>Put their body weight in their bottom (as if they were about to sit on a chair).</li>
                <li>Tilt the mallet handle backwards towards the body, the mallet head will tilt back.</li>
                <li>As they hit the ball, tell them to relax their grip on the mallet and don't follow through. (It takes a while to learn, but the marker under the target ball helps them see what they have achieved). </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Jump Shot </strong>
              <ul>
                <li>This shot is used when an opponent ball gets stuck in a hoop your ball is in a position to make the hoop. The only way to make the hoop is to jump the ball over the one already in the hoop. </li>
                <li>Explain where the feet should be positioned and show how the mallet handle must be angled forward. The mallet should hit down on the ball at 2 o'clock.</li>
                <li>Let the beginner have a go. Explain about the potential to damage the lawn. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>This shot takes hours of practice, so don't expect the player to achieve at this point. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Soft Shots around Hoops </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Explain the area in front of the hoop, the "V" from where it is possible to run a hoop. </li>
              <li>Take the ball about two (2) feet to the side of the hoop and have
                the player hit the ball into the &quot;V&quot; area and then run the hoop.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>This &quot;soft&quot; shot can be practiced from any area near the hoop.</p>
          <p><strong>Introduce more Rules</strong></p>
          <p>Explain hampered shots around a hoop. Double taps and other rules about hitting balls.</p>
          <p><strong>A Game</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Explain the thirteen (13) point game. </li>
            <li>Ensure that the beginner understands the hoop order.</li>
            <li>Play a game, but this time be more firm about the rules.</li>
            <li>Emphasise that when the player is going to hit the opponent ball away, hit the ball down the length of the court, don't just tap it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Now that the beginner has been introduced to club members,invite them to join the Club and play along with the club members on Golf Croquet days.</p>

        <h3> <a href="#dmxAccordion1-3"><strong>Lesson Three</strong></a> </h3>
        <div id="dmxAccordion1-3">
          <p><strong>Rules </strong></p>
          <p>Give all new players a copy of the latest rules. Explain some of the more complicated rules. This session can include club members. </p>
          <p><strong>Practice</strong></p>
          <p>Encourage all players to come early and have a big box of balls on hand for them to practice all aspects of the game. Be on hand to correct faults and explain shots. </p>
          <p><strong>A Game to Introduce Tactics </strong></p>
          <p>A game can be played to introduce tactics.Stop a player before they hit and ask then what they are going to do and why. If needed, suggest a better option. The player must remember which ball is to play next before deciding what shot to play. The aim of this lesson is to play with other club members and enjoy the game. You can make this competitive, giving small prizes for the most hoops scored, the longest hoop etc. <br>
