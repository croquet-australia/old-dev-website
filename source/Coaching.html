				<p><strong>In February 2009 the Australian Sports Commision accepted the content, administrative details and coaching methods of the ACA's Coach-training programmes for inclusion in the National  Coaching Accreditation Scheme (NCAS).</strong><br>From now on the Orientation (Aussie Croquet) and Beginner Coaching courses will be recognised by the ACA but not be part of the NCAS.<br> 
The reponsibility for ensuring that Beginner and Level 1 coaches achieve and maintain 
suitable standards of expertise as set out in the Coaching Programmes is delegated to the SCDs.&nbsp; 
The NCD will have more direct involvement and responsibility for the standards of Level 2 coaching and coach 
training, especially in states where the SCD is not accredted at Level 2; though some responsibility can be 
delegated to an authorised coach trainer with Level 2 accreditation.&nbsp; The NCD will take full responsibility 
for the standard of Level 3 coaching and coach training, though that again may be partly delegated to an 
authorised coach trainer with Level 3 accreditation.</p>

                        <div>
                          <p>Croquet Coach training operates as part of the National Coaching Accreditation Scheme (NCAS), which covers over 80 different sports throughout Australia and is managed by the Australian Sports Commission (ASC).</p><p>Croquet Australia has a five-tiered Coach Training Program which is outlined below (Coaching Courses) and except for the Orientation Coach Training Course, the Level 1, 2 and 3 courses are registered and accredited with the ASC. They are reviewed every four years.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3><a href="#"><strong>Who can become a Registered Coach?</strong></a></h3>
                        <div>
                          <p>All registered Croquet players over the age of sixteen years may undertake Croquet Coach training at Beginner Level and Levels 1, 2 and 3. While most of the Orientation Coaches are presently registered croquet players, it is hoped that Phys. Ed. Teachers, parents and even older students will train to become Aussie Croquet Coaches.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3><a href="#"><strong>How do I become a Coach?</strong></a></h3>
                        <div>
                          <p>Each Australian State has an appointed State Coaching Director (SCD) who is listed under State Associations. This should be your first contact as this person can give you all of the information regarding the courses and the fees, plus any course pre-requisites required of you.</p>
                        </div>
 
                         <h3><a href="#"><strong>Can coaches do Private Coaching?</strong></a></h3>
                        <div>
                          <p>Coaches are expected to provide a reasonable amount of coaching at their own club free of charge. They are also asked to assist the sport by coaching at other clubs which do not have registered coaches.</p>

<p>In the case of country clubs without a registered coach, while there is no charge for coaching, the club or its members are expected to at least reimburse travelling expenses and to provide a billet (if needed) for a coach representing the state association.

Registered coaches may offer tuition to individuals or groups of players from whom a fee may be charged.</p>Â 

<p>The fees recommended by the ACA as reasonable are:<br>
$10 per hour for individual coaching <br>
$15 per hour for coaching two players together <br>
$20 per hour for coaching more than two players in a group. <br>
In addition, the players would be expected to cover the coach's travelling costs and any lawn fees required by the club. <br>
It is recommended that coaches not charge for coaching of members of their own club.</p>

<p>NOTE: The above fees are likely to be increased in April 2009, and they are nothing more than "recommended fees". Any coach may negotiate fees either smaller or larger than the recommended fee.</p>
