      <h3><strong>MORE ABOUT THE  SUSTAINABLE COACH SYSTEM:</strong></h3>
      <h4><strong>SUSTAINABLE CLUB  COACHES:</strong> <br />
      </h4>
      <p>Based  around the Schools and Active After-School Community Programs, as part of a  Club&rsquo;s Whole of Life Coaching and Care, we also need to ensure we have the  capacity to continue to provide our services.   So, I am proposing to encourage Clubs to empower themselves to implement  a Sustainable Coach System.  Proceeds  from Schools, Active After Care and general Coaching will be paid to provide a  stream of income to a Coach, who will preferably be a young   person learning Sports Coaching and  Management.  Some duties of Marketing and  Management can also be taken up by such a Club Coach.  The Club would support the &lsquo;business&rsquo; side of  being a Coach, and also provide help where needed.</p>
      <p>The  State Director of Coaching and Sports Development Officer would provide  Professional Development as needed.</p>
      <h5><strong>THE  POSSIBILITIES</strong> </h5>
      
      20  Students at $5.00 per each :  $100<br />
        Coach  gets $80.  <br />
        Coach  can do 3 sessions per day for 3 days 80X3X3 : $720<br />
      And  some Active After Schools at $80 per session.</p>
      <p>It  may be, that the Coach will get $4.00, a Volunteer or Club $1, up to an agreed  figure, equal to the Coaches Award or whatever a Club and Coach contracts them  to receive after which the percentages change.   Additionally, the ACA should be taking a $1 for the costs of the Program  and System, and for an Equalisation Scheme. So, the coach may receive $3.00 and  the Club $1, and the ACA $1.      </p>
      <h5><strong>POSSIBLE  CLUB EQUALISATION SCHEME</strong><br />
      </h5>
      <p>If  the Sustainability System works, we could find some Clubs have lots of Schools  to work with, and others have few.  Some  Clubs could work on a regional basis, and have a Coach for a larger area.</p>
      <p>Some  of this may need seeding, and also, ACA would have costs in its provision of a  National Director of Coaching and the work undertaken.</p>
      <p>So,  ACA may need to take some of the earnings to ensure that less well resourced  clubs can be assisted.  This spirit of  sharing is going to be needed in many sports, which have not yet seen the  problem.</p>
      <h5><strong>SUMMARY OF SCHOOLS COACH JOB :</strong><br />
        Coach  Schools  <br />
        Do  Active After Schools<br />
        Monday  Evening Coaching for all members, including adult and seniors<br />
        Saturday  Welcome for all potential members<br />
        Some  Marketing and Administration.<br />
        Learn  to Coach up to Level 2, then specialise.<br />
      </h5>
      <h4><strong>THE  CLUB AND COACH RELATIONSHIP</strong><br />
      </h4>
      <h5><strong>Overview</strong></h5>
      <p>We  recognise that the amount of Coaching a player needs to complete the  Malletsports Pathway might be between 40 or more Coached sessions, and up to  200 self directed sessions.  No  organisation, despite its desire to fulfill a Duty of Care, can provide that  for nothing.<br />
      After  a point where a player decides to Specialise or grow skills beyond a Club  level, Coaches can charge.</p>
      <p>However,  to offset this, Clubs are encouraged to set up systems of Sustainability for  Coaches, by allowing Coaches to run Schools and Active After Schools Coaches  and use the money as a stream of income for themselves.  VCA wants to encourage Club to empower  themselves to help young Coaches &lsquo;run a Coaching business&rsquo; within the  Club.  </p>
